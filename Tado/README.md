# Tado: A CustomTkinter Todo App with Weather Integration

Tado is a desktop to-do list application built with [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) that allows users to manage daily tasks while displaying current weather information. The application supports adding, editing, completing, and organizing tasks across different days of the week. It also fetches the current temperature based on the user's approximate location using the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) and [ipapi.co](https://ipapi.co/).

## Features

- **Day-Based Task Management**: Manage separate tasks for each day of the week.
- **Add, Edit, and Complete Tasks**: Easily add new tasks, edit existing ones, and mark them as completed.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks and weather data are saved locally to a JSON file (`tasks.json`) and loaded upon startup.
- **Weather Integration**: Fetches and displays the current temperature for the user's location.
- **Responsive UI**: A scrollable list of tasks with a fixed header and day blocks for smooth navigation.
- **Dark Mode & Custom Themes**: Built with CustomTkinter to provide a modern, dark-themed interface.

**Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install customtkinter requests
   ```

   Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

## Running the App

To launch Tado, simply run:

```bash
python tado.py
```

This will open the desktop application window where you can manage your tasks and view weather updates.
